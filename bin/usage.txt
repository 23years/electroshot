    --delay <ms>       Waits a number of milliseconds before taking a screenshot. Defaults to 0,

    --selector <expr>  Captures a specific DOM element using a CSS selector using document.querySelector.
                       The screenshot is cropped and sized to match the element as it appears on the page.

    --quality <0..100> Sets the jpg quality parameter (default: 75).

    --force-device-scale-factor <n>   Forces Chrome to use a specific hidpi scale factor.

    --proxy-server <address:port>     Use a specified proxy server. Only affects HTTP and HTTPS requests.

TODO

    file://...         Captures a local file by loading the file URL directly, without a static file server.

    --user-agent <string>  Sets a custom user agent string.

    --cookie <cookie>   Sets a custom cookie. Can be set multiple times.

    --debug            Verbose debugging mode.

    --max-wait <ms>    Set a maximum wait timer, after which a single screenshot is timed out. Good for automation.
